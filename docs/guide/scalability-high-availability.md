# Scalability & High Availability

## Vertical Scalability
- Increasing the size of an instance
- Common for non distributed system like database.
- ie. RDS, Elasticache can scale vertically

## Horizontal Scalability (Elasticity)
- Increasing number of instances/systems
- Implies distributed system
- Scale out = increase instances

## High Availability
- Running app/system in at least 2 data centers (Availability Zones)
- Purpose is to survive data center loss
